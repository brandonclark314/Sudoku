# Sudoku
A sudoku environment that allows for human solving or computer solving.

This was made using the [p5 web-editor](editor.p5js.org). It was made using the P5 libraries and allows for a user to create their own sudoku or input the numbers from an existing sudoku. The user can then either solve the sudoku themself or have the computer solve it for them. The computer solver uses back-tracking to find the solution to the puzzle.
